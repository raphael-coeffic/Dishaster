# Level Design – Dishaster  

## 1. Tutorial

### 1.1 Level Goals  
The purpose of the Tutorial level is to introduce the player to the core mechanics of Dishaster in a safe, low-pressure environment.  
The player learns how to move around the hall, serve basic orders, collect tips, understand the game, and meet the Boss for the first time without any real danger.  
The goal is to ensure that the player feels comfortable before entering the real chaotic flow of the game.

### 1.2 Active Mechanics  
- Movement: The player practices walking around the banquet hall using basic controls.  
- Basic Serving: A single table flashes to request a simple item (e.g., water or meat). The player approaches, serves, and completes their first task.  
- Collecting Tips: A glowing tip appears after the first service, teaching the quick-pickup mechanic and tip expiration timing.  
- Boss Introduction: The Boss enters the hall for a short cutscene. His vision cone is shown, but he cannot fire the player in this level only reprimand the player.  
- Fake-Work Preview: A short prompt explains fake-working mechanic(polishing glasses, rearranging silverware), but the player is not required to perform it yet(not mandatory for this level).

### 1.3 Environmental Complexity  
- Number of Tables: 1–2 widely spaced tables for easy navigation.  
- Guest Types: Only calm, patient guests with very slow patience decay.  
- Obstacles: Dancer only on the dancefloor, no slippery floors, and no random chaos events.  
- Hall Layout: A simplified version of the banquet hall with guiding arrows, glowing highlights, and clear visual markers for kitchen/table locations.

### 1.4 Resources & Limitations  
- Time Limit: Very generous (90 seconds) to reduce pressure and allow learning at the player’s pace.  
- Failure Conditions: The player cannot be fired in this level. Mistakes only trigger friendly hints such as “Work!” or “Guests won’t wait forever!”  
- Energy: Energy does not deplete in the tutorial to keep focus on understanding the mechanics rather than resource management.

Litlle map with kitchen in the corner, a danceflour in the background but far from the tables. Only 3 tables, a Dj in the side and next to him, the bar.


## 2. Easy

### 2.1 Level Goals  
The Easy level introduces the real gameplay flow of Dishaster with a light amount of pressure.  
The player begins to manage multiple tables, react faster to orders, avoid the Boss’s vision, and deal with the first small chaotic elements.  
The goal is to transition the player smoothly from a safe learning environment to an active and engaging shift.

### 2.2 Active Mechanics  
- Multiple Serving Tasks: 2-3 tables can request service, sometimes at the same time. Orders still remain simple (e.g., water, meat, dessert).  
- Patience Bars: Guests now lose patience faster, encouraging quicker movement and decision-making.  
- Collecting Tips: Tips expire more quickly than in the tutorial, teaching the player to optimize movement.  
- Boss Patrol (Low Danger): The Boss now patrols the hall. If he catches the player doing something suspicious, he gives a strong warning. The player can be fired only for obvious misbehavior (drinking, dancing).  
- Fake-Work (Useful): Fake-work becomes relevant when the Boss approaches. It helps avoid reprimands but is still easy to perform.  
- Basic Chaos Events: A glass can fall on the floor, or a guest may complain loudly, slightly distracting the player.

### 2.3 Environmental Complexity  
- Number of Tables: Increased to 2–3 for the player and one other npc that serve 3 other tables.  
- Guest Types: Introduction of VIP guests who require faster service or special items like find for him a cigar cutter.  
- Obstacles: One dancer moving occasionally out of the dancefloor and a small spilled drink area that slightly slows the player.  
- Hall Layout: Slightly larger, giving the player more space to navigate but also more distance between tables.

### 2.4 Resources & Limitations  
- Time Limit: Moderate (70–80 seconds), requiring more efficient task management.  
- Failure Conditions: If the Boss catches the player performing risky actions, the shift ends and many guests losing patience results in a “Poor Performance” ending.  
- Energy: Energy begins to drain slowly when running or when performing tasks for too long, introducing basic resource management.

### 2.5 Description of the map
Small map with kitchen in the corner, a danceflour closer to the tables. 6 tables, a Dj in the side and next to him, the bar.

## 3. Medium

### 3.1 Level Goals  
The Medium level increases the challenge and requires the player to manage several tasks at once.  
The player must react to faster orders, navigate around multiple obstacles, use fake-work more strategically, and avoid a Boss with a more unpredictable patrol.  
The goal is to push the player into real multitasking and teach them to prioritize tasks under pressure.

### 3.2 Active Mechanics  
- More Complex Serving Tasks: 3-4 tables can request service, with mixed orders (e.g., drink + dessert, or a two-step task like picking up food from the kitchen and getting cutlery).  
- Lower Patience: Guests lose patience noticeably faster, forcing the player to choose which tables to save first.  
- Collecting Tips: Tips expire very quickly, rewarding efficient movement and route planning.  
- Boss Patrol (Medium Danger): The Boss moves faster and changes direction unexpectedly. If he sees the player idle or performing risky actions, the player can be fired immediately.  
- Fake-Work (Important): Fake-work becomes a vital mechanic. Using it late or in the wrong moment can result in a reprimand or firing.  
- Chaos Events: Soup or drinks can spill and slow the player down, a drunk guest may wander randomly, blocking movement, plates can fall, creating temporary noise distractions.  

### 3.3 Environmental Complexity  
- Number of Tables: 3-4 player-managed tables scattered across a larger space and two others npc that serve 6 other tables.  
- Guest Types: VIP guests appear more often, and some guests have very low patience.  
- Obstacles: Two dancers moving unpredictably, one drunk NPC walking through the hall randomly and  a spilled drink area that slows movement significantly.  
- Hall Layout: Larger map with narrower paths between tables, forcing the player to plan routes more carefully.

### 3.4 Resources & Limitations  
- Time Limit: Slightly shorter (60–70 seconds), increasing the overall pressure.  
- Failure Conditions: Getting caught performing risky actions instantly ends the shift and Several guests leaving due to impatience triggers a “Bad Performance” ending.  
- Energy: Energy drains faster when running or performing tasks without breaks. The player must manage micro-pauses or grab small snacks to refill energy.

### 3.5 Description of the map  
A medium-sized map with a kitchen on the right side and a dancefloor placed closer to the center of the hall.  
There are 10 tables spread across the area, creating tighter movement spaces.  
Two dancers and one drunk npc move around, increasing unpredictability.  
The DJ booth and bar are more central, making the environment feel livelier but also more chaotic.


## 4. Hard

### 4.1 Level Goals  
The Hard level represents the most chaotic and demanding version of a Dishaster shift.  
The player must handle rapid orders, extremely impatient guests, a dangerous Boss with unpredictable movement, and multiple overlapping chaos events.  
The goal is to challenge the player’s speed, awareness, decision-making, and mastery of all mechanics learned so far.

### 4.2 Active Mechanics  
- High-Pressure Serving Tasks: 4–5 player-managed tables can request service almost simultaneously, with mixed or multi-step orders (e.g., drink, dessert and VIP request).  - Very Low Patience: Guests lose patience extremely fast, forcing the player to prioritize perfectly and move constantly.  
- Fast Tip Expiration: Tips disappear quickly, rewarding efficient path planning and punishing hesitation.  
- Boss Patrol (High Danger): The Boss moves quickly across the hall with a wider vision cone and unpredictable route changes. If he catches the player being idle or doing something risky, the shift ends instantly.  
- Fake-Work (Critical): The player must use fake-work frequently and at the right moments to avoid the Boss. Timing mistakes often lead to immediate firing.  
- Intense Chaos Events: Multiple drinks or soups can spill at once, creating several slow zones. Dancers may suddenly rush across the hall. A drunk guest can block key paths. The DJ may trigger loud sound effects or flashing lights, briefly confusing the player.  

### 4.3 Environmental Complexity  
- Number of Tables: 4–5 player-managed tables, with 3 additional npc waiters managing 8 other tables.  
- Guest Types: Many VIP guests with highly demanding service speeds.  
- Obstacles: Three dancers moving unpredictably. One drunk ncp constantly wandering through the tables. Several spilled drink zones that slow movement dramatically.  
- Hall Layout: A large map with narrow corridors between tables, requiring precise navigation and smart route planning.

### 4.4 Resources & Limitations  
- Time Limit: Short (50–60 seconds), creating continuous pressure.  
- Failure Conditions:  
  - Getting caught by the Boss while performing risky actions or doesn't working ends the shift instantly. Losing too many guests due to impatience results in a “Disaster Shift” ending.  
- Energy: Energy drains very quickly when running or performing tasks for long periods. The player must take quick micro-breaks or grab desserts to stay efficient. Poor energy management leads to slower movement, making the level much harder.

### 4.5 Description of the map  
A large and crowded banquet hall with 13 tables in total.  
The kitchen is located far from the main serving area, increasing travel time.  
The dancefloor is very close to the tables, making dancers a constant threat.  
Three dancers and a drunk NPC move around unpredictably, and spilled drink areas appear frequently.  
The DJ booth triggers random sound/light effects, creating the most chaotic and challenging environment in the game.
