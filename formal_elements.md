# Dishaster
**Welcome to Dishaster — the only job where spilling drinks, dodging the boss, and flirting for tips are part of the shift!**

## Concept:
Dishaster is a fast-paced, humorous management and stealth game where you play as a banquet waiter working at chaotic events — weddings, galas, and bar mitzvahs. Your goal is to serve as many guests as possible, collect big tips, and survive the night without getting caught slacking by the terrifying head waiter. Players must balance between doing their job, sneaking in risky fun moments (like drinking with guests), and improvising fake tasks when danger approaches. Every event brings new challenges, hilarious NPCs, and unexpected chaos — turning ordinary catering into pure comedy.

Platform:
The game is designed for PC and mobile (Android/iOS), making it perfect for both short casual sessions and longer gameplay experiences.

## ⚙️ Formal Elements
### 1. Players

Dishaster is designed for casual to mid-core players aged 12–35 who enjoy comedic chaos, time pressure, and strategy in short, replayable bursts.
It’s primarily a single-player game but could support an optional local co-op/versus mode, where two waiters compete for tips — or sabotage each other by “accidentally” spilling soup.
Interactions are mostly with AI-driven guests and the boss, but the dynamic environment makes every shift feel alive and unpredictable.

### 2.Goals

The main goal is simple: survive your shift and earn as many tips as possible before the event ends.
To win, players must:

Serve guests quickly (drinks, dishes, desserts).

Complete timed missions like “Deliver champagne to Table 5 in under 30 seconds.”

Stay under the radar of the head waiter.

Avoid disasters (spills, drunk guests, or food fights).

The player is constantly updated through:

A task bar listing active orders.

Pop-up icons over tables needing attention.

A “Boss Alert” light that flashes red when he’s near.

Comedic sound cues (“DING!” for success, “HEY!” when caught).

### 3.Processes
Start Phase (first 30 seconds)

The game starts with the player entering the banquet hall.
A short cutscene shows the Boss shouting orders and guests already getting rowdy.
The tutorial appears naturally:
👉 “Serve guests. Avoid the boss. Don’t get caught slacking!”
One table flashes to indicate where to go first — fast onboarding, instant fun.

Core Loop

Observe: Look for waving guests or tables flashing yellow (they need service).

Move: Navigate between tables while dodging dancers and staying out of the Boss’s light cone.

Serve: Tap or click to deliver dishes. Perfect timing = higher tips.

Fake work: When the Boss is nearby, hold a button to pretend to:

Polish glasses 🍷

Rearrange cutlery 🍴

Wipe a clean table 🧽

Write fake notes on a notepad 🗒️

Collect tips: Coins and bills appear briefly on tables; grab them before they vanish!

Risk actions: Optional “fun” interactions increase humor and tension:

Take a shot with guests 🥃 → boosts charisma but huge risk if the Boss sees!

Dance near the DJ for stress relief 🕺 → minor tip bonus if unnoticed.

Sneak a dessert from the kitchen 🍰 → quick energy gain but lowers reputation if caught.

Each round becomes faster and more chaotic — slipping on spilled drinks, dodging conga lines, and balancing trays under flashing lights.

End Phase

The shift ends after a set timer (e.g. 5 minutes) or if the Boss fires you on the spot.
You’re immediately graded on:

Tips earned 💰

Guests served ✅

Times caught 🚫

Professionalism score 🌟

Ending screens:

“Perfect Shift” – You’re a banquet legend! Unlocks the next venue.

“Decent Job” – You survived… barely.

“FIRED!” – You were caught drinking with guests, dancing, or breaking plates.

Controls:

PC: WASD + mouse.

Mobile: drag to move, tap to serve/fake tasks, swipe to dodge obstacles.

Learning Curve:
Players learn intuitively through visual and sound feedback — exaggerated animations, color codes, and short prompts make it clear what’s happening at all times.

### 4.Rules

Being caught slacking by the Boss reduces reputation.

Getting caught drinking, dancing, or eating = immediate firing.

You can only carry one tray at a time.

Tips expire if not collected quickly.

Certain tables have VIP guests who demand faster service or special items.

Random chaos events (e.g. broken glass, spilled soup) slow movement unless cleaned up.

Rules are learned naturally as players fail or succeed — “comedic failure” is part of the charm.

### 5.Resources

Tips 💵 – Used to buy upgrades (better shoes, larger tray, charisma perfume).

Reputation ⭐ – Impacts how forgiving the Boss and guests are.

Time ⏱️ – Each round has a strict timer; every second counts.

Energy ⚡ – Drains if running or faking tasks too much; refilled by taking micro-breaks (or… sneaking dessert).

Scarcity is built into the system:

Guests lose patience fast.

Tips disappear quickly.

Only a few safe “hide spots” exist from the Boss’s view.

Resources are shown clearly in the top HUD — Tips Counter, Reputation Bar, and Time Clock.

### 6.Conflicts

Player vs System:

Avoid the Boss’s vision cone.

Manage multiple tables under time pressure.

Handle random chaos (slippery floor, drunk guests, dropped trays).

Player vs Self:

The internal dilemma: “Should I sneak a drink for fun or play it safe?”

Balancing greed and discipline adds personality and humor.

### 7.Boundaries

The game world is semi-open, limited to a single event hall per level.
It includes zones: kitchen, dance floor, tables, and rest area.
The environment is flat and rectangular, but with dynamic obstacles (moving dancers, crowd clusters).

Boundaries are visually clear:

Walls and NPC crowds block paths.

The camera zooms slightly when the player nears the edge.

The “Boss spotlight” visually defines danger zones.

Design Principles:

Meaning: Every area has purpose — kitchen = refill, tables = work, dance floor = distraction.

Mobility: Wide corridors allow fluent movement.

Orientation: Signs like “Kitchen” and “Bar” help navigation.

Interest: Random events make every round different.

Guidance: Light and color cues subtly guide the player toward active tables.

### 8. Outcomes

Possible endings for each shift:

🏆 Perfect Shift: High tips, zero mistakes → unlocks next level and new gear.

😊 Good Enough: Some chaos, but overall success → small reward.

💀 FIRED: Caught drinking with guests, tripping the bride, or setting off the champagne tower.

Success depends 80% on skill, 20% on luck — the Boss’s patrol and guest chaos are semi-random.
The game is non-zero-sum and focuses on replayability — every round is different thanks to procedural events.

### 💡 Why Dishaster is Unique & Better

The Waitress quickly becomes repetitive — every shift feels the same, and there’s no humor or personality in the environment.
Dishaster, on the other hand, adds energy, comedy, and unpredictability. It turns a simple serving job into a chaotic, lighthearted experience with new stories each round.

Key originality points:

Stealth & Humor blend: hiding from the boss while pretending to work adds tension and laughter.

Dynamic chaos system: events like dancing guests, spilled soup, and unpredictable NPCs make every game different.

“Fun-but-risky” actions: taking shots with guests, dancing near the DJ, or sneaking dessert creates hilarious, replayable moments.

Upgrades & replayability: players can customize their waiter with faster shoes, fancy trays, or charisma boosts.

Why players will prefer Dishaster:
Because it’s not just about serving — it’s about surviving the madness of a party while trying to look professional. It’s chill, funny, and full of small stories that make every session different.

### ⭐ Formal Elements that Highlight Originality

Processes:
The gameplay loop (serve → fake tasks → chaos → survive) is unique and fun to repeat. The “Boss Alert” and fake-work mechanic create tension and humor at once.

Conflicts:
The internal dilemma between “be professional” and “have fun” makes each round unpredictable and personal.

Outcomes:
Multiple funny endings (“Perfect Shift,” “Fired for Dancing,” etc.) increase replayability and comedic payoff.
