# 🍽️ Dishaster
**Welcome to Dishaster — the only job where spilling drinks, dodging the boss, and flirting for tips are part of the shift!**

Dishaster is a fast-paced, humorous management and stealth game where you play as a banquet waiter working at chaotic events — weddings, galas, and bar mitzvahs.  
Your goal is simple: serve as many guests as possible, collect generous tips, and survive the night without getting caught slacking by your terrifying boss!  
Mixing time management, stealth, and comedy, Dishaster turns catering into pure chaos and laughter.
